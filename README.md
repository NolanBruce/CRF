Cocktail Recipe Finder

This is a simple web app for finding cocktail recipes from provided ingredients.

The app consists of a Python (Flask) backend, a React frontend, and a Postgres database.

Feel free to play around with it from the link below, but don't be too disappointed if your favorite cocktail is missing as I'm currently working on adding additional recipes to the database.
